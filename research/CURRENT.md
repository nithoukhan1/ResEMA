## Controlling scientific decision

`CORRECTED_MODULE_FAMILY_SCREEN_CLOSED=TRUE`

`SELECTED_FAMILY_CANDIDATE=YOLO11s + SCConv-Early`

`GLOBAL_FINAL_PAPER_ARCHITECTURE_FROZEN=FALSE`

`REPLACEMENT_RESEARCH_PENDING_RESIDUAL_DIAGNOSIS=TRUE`

`NEW_GPU_TRAINING_AUTHORIZED=FALSE`

`TEST_ACCESS=NONE`

Canonical EMA remains an individually positive corrected ablation.
The combination result does not establish a causal explanation for its
negative interaction with SCConv-Early.

## Current task

A12-D0 six-model diagnostic artifact inventory is complete.

All six canonical final artifacts are locally recoverable and hash-verified:

- frozen YOLO11s baseline;
- SCConv-Early;
- SCConv-4Stage;
- DySample;
- Canonical EMA;
- SCConv-Early + Canonical EMA.

A12-D0A also consolidated both COMB session archives into the governed
external-artifact store without modifying the scientific repository.

Next:

`A12-D1_STANDARDIZED_VALIDATION_DIAGNOSTIC_PREFLIGHT`

The next phase remains validation-only. It must establish one common
evaluation and prediction-export protocol before any diagnostic inference.

Required comparison:

- frozen YOLO11s baseline;
- SCConv-Early;
- SCConv-4Stage as a placement/intensity control;
- DySample;
- Canonical EMA;
- SCConv-Early + Canonical EMA.

Required questions:

- what errors does SCConv-Early fix?
- why does SCConv-4Stage change the precision-recall behavior?
- why does DySample underperform the baseline in this frozen condition?
- does DySample fail by class, object size, confidence, localization,
  cross-scale alignment, or because upsampling is not the bottleneck?
- what errors does Canonical EMA fix?
- which fixes disappear in the SCConv-Early + Canonical EMA combination?
- what residual errors remain after SCConv-Early?
- should the next mechanism target upsampling, feature refinement,
  localization, rare-class behavior, or another demonstrated bottleneck?

Do not choose a replacement module before this diagnostic.

Do not start new GPU training.

Split-B test remains sealed.
